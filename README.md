# Axiomatic Criterion Engine (ACE)
### Ontological Discernment Engine for LLM Systems  
**Reference Implementation: Semantic Security Gateway Firewall (SSGF)**

## Why This Exists

Most LLM-based systems waste **70–90% of compute and tokens** processing
low-signal, ambiguous, or semantically manipulative inputs.

This repository implements a **deterministic layer of ontological discernment**
that filters entropy **before** probabilistic reasoning occurs.

The result:
- Lower cost
- Fewer hallucinations
- Auditable decisions
- Preserved creativity without censorship

## What This Project Is

This repository contains the **reference implementation of the
Axiomatic Criterion Engine (ACE)**, exposed operationally through the
**Semantic Security Gateway Firewall (SSGF)**.

SSGF is the *execution layer*.  
ACE is the *decision engine*.

SSGF is **not**:
- a prompt
- a chatbot
- a moderation API

SSGF is **deterministic decision infrastructure**.

## The New AI Standard: Ontological Discernment

**ACE transforms LLMs from probabilistic predictors into axiomatic decision systems.**

Instead of asking *“what is likely?”*, ACE asks:

- Is this input **coherent with reality**?
- Is it **ambiguous**, **manipulative**, or **entropic**?
- Does it belong to **objective reality**, **fiction**, or **error**?

By separating **Truth from Entropy** and **Reality from Hallucination**,  
ACE reduces unnecessary inference while preserving valid imagination and art.

ACE (Axiomatic Criterion Engine) introduces a deterministic layer of
**ontological discernment** that operates *before* probabilistic inference.

Instead of relying solely on likelihood and token prediction,
ACE evaluates inputs through an axiomatic structure that distinguishes:

- Truth from Entropy  
- Reality from Hallucination  
- Valid Context from Ontological Error  

This allows LLM systems to reject, redirect, or contextualize inputs
*before* expensive reasoning occurs — reducing hallucinations,
preventing manipulation, and saving significant computation.

ACE is derived from **The Axiom of the Absolute**, a formally published
ontological framework, and translates its principles into an executable
discernment layer for AI systems.

## How SSGF and ACE Work Together

SSGF operates as a **two-stage decision gateway**:

### 1️⃣ FAST Pipeline (Local, Deterministic — SSGF)

Executed for **every input**, with <1–5ms latency:

- Normalization
- Hard Triggers (spam, phishing, injection)
- Structural Entropy Scoring
- Intention Heuristics
- Decision:
  - `ALLOW`
  - `WARN`
  - `BLOCK`
  - `ESCALATE`

Most inputs terminate here.

---

### 2️⃣ DEEP Pipeline (Ontological — ACE)

**Triggered only when ambiguity remains.**

This stage invokes the **Axiomatic Criterion Engine (ACE)** to perform
**ontological discernment**, not probabilistic guessing.

ACE:
- Classifies intention (Seeker vs Error-Validator)
- Distinguishes **Reality / Fiction / Manipulation**
- Enforces Truth → Being → Action consistency
- Prevents hallucination without censoring fiction or art

This is where **discernment replaces probability**.

## Quickstart (2 minutes)

```bash
npm install llm-entropy-filter
````

```js
import { gate } from "llm-entropy-filter";

const result = gate("FREE crypto bonus!!!");

console.log(result);
```

### Example Output

```json
{
  "action": "WARN",
  "entropy_score": 0.38,
  "flags": ["shouting", "spam_kw_free"],
  "intention": "marketing_spam",
  "confidence": 0.75
}
```

## Integration Options

1️⃣ **Local SDK**
Embed directly into Node.js services.

2️⃣ **Express Middleware**

```js
app.post("/chat", ssgfMiddleware, forwardToLLM);
```

3️⃣ **Reverse Proxy**
Client → SSGF → OpenAI / Anthropic / Ollama

4️⃣ **Hybrid Escalation (Recommended)**
Deterministic FAST → Ontological ACE only if needed.

## Rulesets

Rules are JSON-based and fully auditable.

* `default.json` → Balanced
* `strict.json` → High-security
* `custom.json` → Domain-specific

Rules control:

* Thresholds
* Hard triggers
* Escalation behavior

## Foundational Axiom

ACE is derived from **The Axiom of the Absolute**, a formally published ontological
framework archived in Zenodo.

ACE does not invent this axiom — it operationalizes it as a deterministic
decision layer for AI systems.
